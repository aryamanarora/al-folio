I am doing a double major B.S. degree in Computer Science and Linguistics at Georgetown University. I do **computational linguistics** research as a member of [NERT](http://nert.georgetown.edu/), [Dr. Nathan Schneider](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/)'s research group at Georgetown. I'm excited about technologies for **South Asian languages** and linguistic work on **Indo-Aryan languages**.

I'm an admin on the [English Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:AryamanA) where I manage South Asian language documentation. I love learning languages---besides being a native speaker of Hindi and English, I'm comfortable with Urdu and Punjabi and am actively learning Mandarin and Sanskrit. I also run a South Asian linguistics reading group, [Moḻi-maṇḍala](https://aryamanarora.github.io/moli-mandala/).

I like to bicycle (though not very well), read (in English and Hindi, but the latter not very well), and eat unreasonable amounts of food relative to my size. I'd also say I like to go places, but we're in the middle of a pandemic. With my friend Ananya Gulati, I run [Washingtutors](http://washingtutors.org/), an online tutoring non-profit for students in the D.C. Public School system (in which I spent my best years of high school, at the [School Without Walls](https://www.swwhs.org/)).
