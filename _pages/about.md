Hi, I'm Aryaman! I'm an undergrad at Georgetown University studying computer science and linguistics. I do **computational linguistics** research as a member of [NERT](http://nert.georgetown.edu/), [Nathan Schneider](http://people.cs.georgetown.edu/nschneid/)'s research group at Georgetown. For this summer, I am a research intern at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) with [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/). I'm excited about making technologies for **South Asian languages** and doing linguistic work on **Indo-Aryan languages**.

I love learning languages---besides being a native speaker of Hindi and English, I'm comfortable with Urdu and Punjabi and am actively learning Mandarin and Sanskrit. I'm an admin on the [English Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/User:AryamanA) where I manage South Asian language documentation. I also run a South Asian linguistics reading group, [Moḻi-maṇḍala](https://aryamanarora.github.io/moli-mandala/).

I like to bicycle (though not very well), read (in English and Hindi, but the latter not very well), and eat unreasonable amounts of food relative to my size. I'd also say I like to go places, but we're in the middle of a pandemic. With my friend Ananya Gulati, I founded [Washingtutors](http://washingtutors.org/), an online tutoring non-profit for students in the D.C. Public School system (in which I spent my best years of high school, at the [School Without Walls](https://www.swwhs.org/)).
