I developed and annotated several corpora using the [Semantic Network of Adposition and Case Supersenses (SNACS)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1018/), an annotation scheme maintained by the cross-university [CARMLS research group](https://github.com/carmls).

Some of the subprojects involving SNACS that I worked on:

- The creation of Hindi--Urdu SNACS guidelines and the annotation of the Hindi translation of *The Little Prince* with Nitin Venkateswaran in 2020--2021. We intend to develop an automatic neural tagger for Hindi and look at cross-lingual problems (e.g. alignment and transfer learning).
- The annotation of *The Little Prince* in English during summer 2020 with [Emma Manning](https://esmanning.github.io/) and Sasha Slone.
- [Maitrey Mehta](https://sites.google.com/view/maitreymehta/home) started Gujarati annotation in December 2020, and I met with him several times to compare annotations with Hindi and help resolve linguistic issues found in Gujarati.
- Analysis of the [PASTRIE corpus](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.law-1.10/), which looks at L2 English speech collected from the internet.

I also discussed with Bill Croft about [Uniform Meaning Representation (UMR)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13218-021-00722-w) (specifically, the handling of causatives in Hindi).
