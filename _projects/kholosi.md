I began documenting [Kholosi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kholosi_language) with my informant Ahmed Etebari as part of my final project in LING-001 (Introduction to Language) at Georgetown. Kholosi is spoken in Kholos and Gotaw, two villages of Hormozgan province. It is unique for being an Indo-Aryan language of Iran that is very deep inland and entirely surrounded by distantly- or un-related languages; it is not clear yet how or when its speakers arrived there. Furthermore, it is clearly not one of the usual migratory IA languages (like Zargari Romani or Domari in Iran) but rather a Sindhic-family language.

Kholosi speakers offer a unique context to study language contact and the history of the Sindhic family. Also, Kholosi is unwritten and not well-documented, and speakers like my informant are eager to increase awareness of the language since it has no official status.

I have worked with [Maryam Nourzaei](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N11-902), [Erik Anonby](https://carleton.ca/french/people/erik-anonby-2/) (who wrote the first English scholarly work on the language in 2016), and [Mortaza Taheri-Ardali](https://sku.ac.ir/en/DepartmentGroup/ProfessorForm.aspx?ID=2348) on this.

The plan is to publish a phonological description in JIPA in mid-2021 (draft is ready, awaiting collection of recordings), upload the dictionary to Dictionaria and Wiktionary (probably mid-2021), publish some work on Kholosi from a historical/comparative perspective (by late 2021), and study contact with Persian (2022).
