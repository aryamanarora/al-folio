    abstract={These are the guidelines for the application of SNACS (Semantic Network of Adposition and Case Supersenses; Schneider et al. 2018) to Modern Standard Hindi of Delhi. SNACS is an inventory of 50 supersenses (semantic labels) for labelling the use of adpositions and case markers with respect to both lexical-semantic function and relation to the underlying context. The English guidelines (Schneider et al., 2020) were used as a model for this document.
    
    Besides the case system, Hindi has an extremely rich adpositional system built on the oblique genitive, with productive incorporation of loanwords even in present-day Hinglish.
    
    This document is aligned with version 2.5 of the English guidelines.},

We present the first statistical schwa deletion classifier for Hindi, which relies solely on the orthography as the input and outperforms previous approaches. We trained our model on a newly-compiled pronunciation lexicon extracted from various online dictionaries. Our best Hindi model achieves state of the art performance, and also achieves good performance on a closely related language, Punjabi, without modification.},

    abstract={Most of the robotic exoskeletons available today are either lower extremity or upper extremity devices targeting individual orthotic (elbow, knee, and ankle) joints. However, there are a few which target both lower and upper extremities. This chapter aims to propose a design for a wearable quasi-passive lower and upper extremity robotic exoskeleton (QLUE-REX) system, targeting disabled users and aged seniors. This exoskeleton system aims to improve mobility, assist walking, improve and enhance muscle strength, and help people with leg/arm disabilities. QLUE-REX combines elbow, knee, and ankle joints with options to synchronize individual joints’ movements to achieve the following: (1) assist in lifting loads of 30–40 kilograms, (2) assist in walking, (3) easy and flexible to wear without any discomfort, and (4) be able to learn and adapt along with storing time-stamped sensor data on its exoskeleton storage media for predicting/correcting users’ movements and share data with health professionals. The research’s main objective is to conceptualize a design for QLUE-REX system. QLUE-REX will be a feasible modular-type wearable system that incorporates orthotic elbow, knee, and ankle joints effectively in either synchronous or asynchronous modes depending on the users’ needs. It will utilize human-walking analysis, data sensing and estimation technology, and measurement of the electromyography signals of user’s muscles, exploiting biomechanical principles of human-machine interface.}
